Hi there! I'm Ivonna, an enthusiastic programmer with a passion for learning and creating. 
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.

🏆 Goals
- Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.
- Build a personal website or blog to share my learning journey.
- Continuously improve my coding skills and work towards becoming a full-stack developer.

✨ Fun Facts
- When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about neuroscience, walking shelter dogs or photographing nature.
